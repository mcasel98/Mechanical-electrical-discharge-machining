# Introduction

**Mechanical Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM)** is a technology that uses electrical discharges to erode metals immersed in a dielectric fluid. The process is based on a circuitry that opens and closes rapidly, generating high-temperature sparks that melt and remove tiny amounts of material from the workpiece, enabling drilling even in very hard metals such as tungsten.

This setup uses a low-power device, supporting 2–3 mm drill bits and offering voltage and current control. The system is designed for repeatable and efficient cycles, optimizing drilling speed and equipment protection.
